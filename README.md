# ad_classification

code for data preprocessing, training and evaulating models. Take a look at baseline_mlp.py
to see how to create a model, train it (training saves best model and plots training curves), 
then evaluate it (evaluation is on test set and gives confusion matrix, F1 score and accuracy)
